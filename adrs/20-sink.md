# ADR 20: Sink Selection - Vessel Sink Compatible with Regular Faucets

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Aliona wanted a vessel sink for the bathroom vanity. Vessel sinks typically require specialized tall faucets to accommodate their height above the countertop, which can complicate installation and limit faucet options.

## Decision
We selected a vessel sink that can be used with a regular bathroom faucet instead of requiring a specialized vessel sink faucet.

## Rationale
- **Compatibility**: This sink works with standard bathroom faucets, avoiding the need for specialized tall vessel faucets
- **Flexibility**: Provides more options for faucet selection without height constraints
- **Ease of Installation**: Simplifies plumbing and installation compared to traditional vessel sinks
- **User Preference**: Satisfies Aliona's desire for a vessel sink aesthetic
- **Practicality**: Reduces complexity in parts procurement and installation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Can use the existing or preferred standard bathroom faucet
- Easier to find replacement parts if needed
- More straightforward installation process
- Lower overall cost compared to specialized vessel sink faucets

### Negative
- May have a lower profile than traditional vessel sinks
- Aesthetic may differ slightly from conventional vessel sink installations
