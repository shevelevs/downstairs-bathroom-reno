# ADR 21: Vanity Selection - Offset Design with Toekick

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The bathroom renovation required selecting a vanity that would:
- Accommodate the chosen vessel sink
- Provide adequate counter space for daily use
- Match aesthetic preferences
- Fit within the 42" wall space allocated for the vanity

## Decision
Selected an offset vanity (Ariel Hepburn T042S-L-BC-GRY) with the following characteristics:
- 42" W × 34.5" H × 21.5" D
- Sink positioned on the left side (over 22.5" large drawer section)
- Additional counter space on the right (over 13.5" small drawer section)
- Toekick base design (vs. exposed legs)
- Two doors and five drawers for storage

## Rationale

### Offset Sink Placement
Aliona specifically wanted the sink shifted to the left rather than centered. Her preference is to have more usable counter space consolidated on one side rather than dividing it between two sides. This provides:
- A larger contiguous work area on the right side
- More practical space for toiletries and daily items
- Better workflow for getting ready

### Width Constraints
The 42" vanity width was necessary to:
- Accommodate the 20.88" wide sink with proper clearance
- Fit within the available wall space
- Provide adequate storage

This width constraint limited the pool of candidate vanities significantly.

### Toekick vs. Exposed Legs
We preferred the toekick design over exposed leg styles because:
- Cleaner, more modern appearance
- Easier to clean (no legs to work around)
- More stable base
- Better suited to the bathroom's aesthetic

## Consequences

### Positive
- Optimized counter space layout matching user preferences
- Asymmetric design provides practical benefits for daily use
- Toekick design is easier to maintain
- Ample storage with two-section drawer configuration
- Sink fits properly with appropriate clearances

### Negative
- Offset design may limit future sink replacement options
- Less flexibility in mirror and fixture placement (must account for asymmetric layout)
- Toekick design cannot be adjusted for uneven floors as easily as leg-style vanities
