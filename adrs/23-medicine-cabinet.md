# ADR 23: Medicine Cabinet

**Status:** Proposed (In Discussion)

**Date:** 2025-12-21

## Context

The medicine cabinet wall (65" wide × 96" tall) is located to the left of the vanity wall. The vanity extends 21.5" into this wall space from the right edge.

Key constraints and considerations:
- Washing machine plumbing runs through this wall, limiting placement options for recessed installations
- Need to decide between recessed vs. surface-mounted installation
- The vanity's position may need adjustment depending on medicine cabinet placement
- Lighting integration is desired

## Decision

**Under Discussion** - Multiple options being evaluated:

### Option A: Surface-Mounted Cabinet
- **Pros:**
  - More flexible placement - can be mounted almost anywhere on the wall
  - Easier installation - no framing or wall modification required
  - Not constrained by stud locations or plumbing
- **Cons:**
  - Projects from wall, may need to shift vanity to the right to maintain clearance
  - Less integrated look

### Option B: Recessed Cabinet
- **Pros:**
  - Flush with wall for cleaner, integrated appearance
  - Doesn't project into the room
  - More modern aesthetic
- **Cons:**
  - Limited placement options - must fit between studs (typically 14.5" or 30.5" wide openings)
  - Washing machine plumbing in the wall restricts possible locations
  - May require framing around the cabinet if it doesn't align with studs
  - More complex installation

### Option C: Medicine Cabinet Mirror (on Vanity Wall)
- **Pros:**
  - Combines mirror and storage in one unit
  - Available with integrated lighting
  - Simplifies the medicine cabinet wall - no additional work needed on left wall
  - Centered positioning over vanity
- **Cons:**
  - May limit mirror size options
  - Storage access might interfere with vanity use
  - Different aesthetic than separate mirror + medicine cabinet

## Open Questions

1. What are the exact locations of the washing machine plumbing lines in the medicine cabinet wall?
2. What are the stud locations on the medicine cabinet wall?
3. How much clearance is needed between a surface-mounted cabinet and the vanity?
4. What storage capacity is required?
5. Is integrated lighting preferred on the medicine cabinet or as separate fixtures?
6. Would a medicine cabinet mirror on the vanity wall provide sufficient storage?

## Notes

Decision depends on:
- Precise measurements of plumbing locations
- Storage requirements
- Aesthetic preferences (recessed vs. surface-mounted vs. mirror cabinet)
- Budget considerations for installation complexity
