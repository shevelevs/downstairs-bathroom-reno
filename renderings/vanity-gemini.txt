Make a rendering of the vanity according to the attached architectural drawings
and photos of the actual components/materials. 

Make sure to

* take into account all dimensions, alignments etc.
* use the actual components from the respective photos, for example do not try to change the
  vanity by adding more drawers than present in the photos or try to make the vanity L-shaped,
  use the exact vanity shape from the provided photos with dimensions specific in the drawings
* obey the height of the backsplash and position of the electric outlet, these
  details are important

Note that

* the sink is a vessel sink
* the sink is not centered over the vanity, instead it is centered over the the "large drawers"
  side of the vanity
* the vanity is adjacent to 2 walls, on the left and on the back of the vanity
* there's a 3'' filler of the matching color between the vanity and the left wall 

You can pick wall colors as they are not known yet and are not in the photos.
