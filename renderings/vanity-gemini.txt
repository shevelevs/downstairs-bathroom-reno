Make a rendering of the vanity in the corner according to the attached architectural drawings
and photos of the actual components/materials. 

Make sure to

* take into account all dimensions, alignments etc.
* use the actual components from the respective photos, for example do not try to change the
  vanity by adding more drawers than present in the photos

Note that the sink is a vessel sink, and it is not centered over the vanity,
it is centered over the left side of it (over the "large drawers").

You can pick wall colors as they are not known yet and are not in the photos.
